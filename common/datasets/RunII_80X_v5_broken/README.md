RunII_80X_v5
============

This is for datasets for HOTVR/XCone studies.
Notable changes:

- Running XCone & HOTVR with both CHS & PUPPI
- XCone now using PseudoXConePlugin
- Gen-level XCone & HOTVR now use GenParticles without neutrinos
- Move to ungroomed AK8PUPPI TopJets (patJetsAk8PuppiJetsSoftDropPacked_daughters -> packedPatJetsAk8PuppiJets_SoftDropPuppi)

Happy analysing!
